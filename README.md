# Ethiopian_Recipe_App
I created a secure Ethiopian Recipe App using Java.

#Installation Instructions
After downloading this reposity, you can run the program on several IDE such as Eclipse. Once you run the program it will ask you for login information. 
The login details are username: ethiopia
                      password: megeb
the password megeb was inspired by me because it's the translation of food in Amharic which is the official langauge in Ethiopia.

#Usage
This app is very useful for anyone who is trying to explore Ethiopian cuisines and wants to know
the famous food. It is designed for anyone around the world interested in the unique Ethiopian foods
that are full of nutrients. I grew up eating these foods on a daily basis and this app was a way to inform the world about these food. 

#Features
Each of the food recipes are categorized by appetizers and entrees (for now).
When you click on any food it displays a brief description on the right pane.
You can pick a category from the drop down to filter your options.
You can search for anyfood by typing in the search box.
You can add any food to the app by using the add recipe feature.
You can delete any food by selected the delete button after selecting a recipe.
You can also choose your favorite foods by clicking on the favorite check box, then clicking on save.

#Contribution
This app doesn't contain a lot of description for the recipe of the food. I did this to allow more Ethiopian to contribute to the app by adding more to the description and many more recipes in whatever category they want.
